# Fract-ol @ 42

##Summary




* Fractol is a 42 Project aimed at exploring fractals; mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale.
* Functions
* Switch between fractls : Mandelbrot, Julia, Burningship.
* Increase and decrease max iteration for shape calculation.
* Zoom and unzoom.
* Different colors patterns.

##Credits
* Wikipedia : Julia Set, Mandelbrot, Burningship.


## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Runs on OS.

Run it with `./fractol [fractal] [color] [type]`. Possible fractals are: `Mandelbrot`, `Julia`,
`Burningship`. Cycle color-schemes with `0-3`. `[<-][^][->]` Use the Arrows to move. Zoom in and out with the
mousewheel.
